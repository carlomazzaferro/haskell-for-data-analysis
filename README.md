# Learning Path: Haskell for Data Analysis by Edwin Moses

It was mentioned through the course that materials would be available online
-- since I could not find them anywhere (check out the Packt Org on [github](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/) by the way for other
great resources), I decided to post them myself.

So far, code for Chapter 1 is available.
